This project presents a comprehensive CPU Scheduling Simulator designed to evaluate and visualize the behavior of six widely studied scheduling algorithms:

 - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
 - Shortest Job First (SJF)
 - Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
 - Round Robin (RR)
 - Preemptive Priority Scheduling
- Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling

The simulator serves as an interactive and educational platform that allows users to experiment with and compare the efficiency, fairness, and responsiveness of these algorithms across a variety of input scenarios.

Key Features:

 - Interactive Input System: Users can input custom parameters such as process arrival times, burst times, priorities, and time quanta (for Round Robin), offering full control over simulation conditions.

 - Dynamic Visualization: The simulator provides a step-by-step representation of process execution, helping users visually track how CPU time is allocated under different algorithms.
 
 - Comprehensive Metrics: Outputs include crucial performance indicators such as:
 
  - Average waiting time
  
  - Turnaround time
  
  - Response time
  
  - CPU utilization
  
  - Throughput
 
 - Comparison Capability: The platform is ideal for comparing how each scheduling strategy handles different workloads, revealing key trade-offs between efficiency, fairness, response time, and complexity.

Educational and Practical Value:

This simulator not only deepens theoretical understanding of operating system concepts, but also offers practical insights into real-world applications. It demonstrates the core principles behind CPU scheduling and the impacts of algorithm choice in system design and performance optimization.

By bridging theory with interactive experimentation, this project is especially useful for:

 - Students studying Operating Systems

 - Educators demonstrating scheduling behavior

 - Developers evaluating algorithmic trade-offs in resource management systems
